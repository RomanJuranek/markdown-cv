- Particle segmentation in images

__Zoner__
- Development of image rectification and horizon detection.

__Camea__

## Misc

For development I use mainly VS Code and Python since it offers large ecosystem of tool for data science and deep learning. I am familiar with **numpy**, **pandas**, **pytorch**, **opencv**, **tensorflow**, **sqlalchemy**, **matplotlib**, **PIL**, **scipy**, **skimage**, **sklearn** and others.

I am falimiar with Git, MQTT, ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ, Postgres.

Fom GIS-world, I can use QGIS (including my own mython extensions an docnnection to remote data sources), PostGIS and python ecosystem for GIS - **geopandas**, **proj**, **osmnx**. I can deploy and customize multiple routing engines like OSRM and Valhalla.

I can use docker for deployment of services (incl. creation of my own images).

So far I was luckily not forced to use corporate stuff like Jira or so. I keep my stuff organized in notes and Trello. But I can learn. I usually communicate through Slack or Discord (or even Teams \*sigh\* :sob:, aways pain), but anything will be ok.
